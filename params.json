{"name":"jquery.linky","tagline":"Linkify URLs, mentions & hashtags","body":"Linky\r\n=====\r\n\r\nLinky is a jQuery plugin for linkifying URLs, mentions (for Twitter, Instagram or GitHub) and hashtags (for Twitter); that is, taking plain text references of URLs, mentions and hashtags and turning them to the appropriate links. Existing linkified URLs are kept untouched.\r\n\r\n## Usage\r\n\r\nThe only dependency is [jQuery](http://jquery.com/).\r\n\r\nAll you have to do is include [`jquery.linky.js`](jquery.inky.js) or [`jquery.linky.min.js`](jquery.linky.min.js) just after you've included `jQuery` and you are all set.\r\n\r\n### Install using Bower\r\nLinky is also available as a Bower package; you can simply install it by doing `bower install jquery.linky`.\r\n\r\n### Options\r\n| Option        | Default     | Type         | Description |\r\n| ------------- |:-----------:| ------------:| -----------:|\r\n| mentions      | `false`     | `boolean`    | Identify if mentions should be linkified. |\r\n| hashtags      | `false`     | `boolean`    | Identify if hashtags should be linkified. |\r\n| urls          | `true`      | `boolean`    | Identify if URLs should be linkified. |\r\n| linkTo        | `\"twitter\"` |  `string`    | Identify location mentions and hashtags should link to|\r\n\r\n### Example\r\n\r\nLinky would come in handy if you are pulling data from any of Twitter's or Instagram's APIs where you will end up having just a plain text string like below:\r\n\r\n`@andreassavvides works on his #opensource projects over at https://github.com/AnSavvides`\r\n\r\nIf you are displaying this information in your UI, you would want to linkify any mentions, hashtags and/or URLs. Linky does exactly that, giving you control over what you want linkified. In this case, let's linkify everything given a `div` containing the aforementioned tweet:\r\n\r\n```html\r\n<div class=\"tweet\">\r\n    @andreassavvides works on his #opensource projects over at https://github.com/AnSavvides        \r\n</div>\r\n```\r\n\r\n```js\r\n$(\".tweet\").linkify({\r\n    mentions: true,\r\n    hashtags: true,\r\n    urls: true,\r\n    linkTo: \"twitter\"\r\n});\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis would transform the `div`'s content to the following:\r\n\r\n```html\r\n<div class=\"url\">\r\n    <a href=\"https://twitter.com/andreassavvides\" target=\"_blank\">@andreassavvides</a> works on his <a href=\"https://twitter.com/search?q=opensource\" target=\"_blank\">#opensource</a> projects over at <a href=\"https://github.com/AnSavvides\" target=\"_blank\">https://github.com/AnSavvides</a>\r\n</div>\r\n```\r\n\r\nHave a look at [examples.html](examples.html) for more examples.\r\n\r\n## Contributing\r\nAll contributions are welcome; just fork the repository, make your changes and open a pull request.\r\n\r\n## License\r\nThe MIT License (MIT)\r\n\r\nCopyright (c) 2013 Andreas Savvides","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
